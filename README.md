# gschem2tikz

The program converts .sch files to TikZ. It works in Linux, probably MacOS X but I don't think in Microsoft Windows will work.

In order to run the program you need to have installed pyqt5 package, you can install it with pip or as want:
```sh
sudo pip install pyqt5
```
and of course python (python 3) in order to run the program is very easy:
```sh
python gschem2tikz.py
```
although in Ubuntu for example is python3 gschem2tikz.py, once you run the GUI, a ~/.gschem2tikz folder will be created for saving all the presets you create for it.

This is the main GUI
